library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
# Creating Exploratory Scatterplot

salmon_scatter <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x=year, y=salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point()
salmon_scatter

#overall there appears to be a relationship between the year and the salmon imports. There are some years that do not meet the expectation of the relationship.

```

```{r}
#Linear Regression

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)
salmon_model

#model equation y=7550x-14982940 or imports(tons)=7550(year)-14982940

#the slope in the context of this model means that for every increase in year there is approximately an increase of 7550 tons of salmon imported

# The Y intercept means that at "year 0" there was -14982920 tons of salmon being imported. That is concerning because that is impossible for a variety of reasons. That means it is not possible to extrapolate data into the past.
